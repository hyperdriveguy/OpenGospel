		<h1>Colossians Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		IF ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
	</p>
</li>
