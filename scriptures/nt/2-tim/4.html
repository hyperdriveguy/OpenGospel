		<h1>2 Timothy Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I CHARGE thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
	</p>
