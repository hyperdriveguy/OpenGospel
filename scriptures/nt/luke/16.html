		<h1>Luke Chapter 16</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
	</p>
