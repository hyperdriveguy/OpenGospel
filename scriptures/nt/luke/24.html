<li name="1">
	<p>
		NOW upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And they remembered his words,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		And he took it, and did eat before them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		And ye are witnesses of these things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
	</p>
