		<h1>Mark Chapter 4</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The sower soweth the word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
	</p>
