		<h1>1 John Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BEHOLD, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.
	</p>
</li>
