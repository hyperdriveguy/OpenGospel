		<h1>Romans Chapter 1</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		PAUL, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
	</p>
