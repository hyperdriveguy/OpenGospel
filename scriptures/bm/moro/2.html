		The words of Christ, which he spake unto his disciples, the twelve whom he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon them--
	</p>

<li name="2">
	<p>
		And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the Father in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye have done this ye shall have power that to him upon whom ye shall lay your hands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give it, for thus do mine apostles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his first appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciples heard it; and on as many as they laid their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.
