<li name="1">
	<p>
		Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the people of Jared, I had supposed not to have written more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not myself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce among themselves; and because of their hatred they put to death every Nephite that will not deny the Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more; but I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.
