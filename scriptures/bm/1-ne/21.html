		<h1>1 Nephi Chapter 21</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken off and are driven out because of the wickedness of the pastors of my people; yea, all ye that are broken off, that are scattered abroad, who are of my people, O house of Israel. Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken ye people from far; the Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And said unto me: Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for naught and in vain; surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And now, saith the Lord--that formed me from the womb that I should be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him--though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And he said: It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nations abhorreth, to servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thus saith the Lord: In an acceptable time have I heard thee, O isles of the sea, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee my servant for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		That thou mayest say to the prisoners: Go forth; to them that sit in darkness: Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And then, O house of Israel, behold, these shall come from far; and lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of those who are in the east shall be established; and break forth into singing, O mountains; for they shall be smitten no more; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me--but he will show that he hath not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Thy children shall make haste against thy destroyers; and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Lift up thine eyes round about and behold; all these gather themselves together, and they shall come to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on even as a bride.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants; and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The children whom thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the first, shall again in thine ears say: The place is too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Then shalt thou say in thine heart: Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? And who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where have they been?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives delivered?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		But thus saith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I, the Lord, am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
	</p>
