		<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MOREOVER he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.
	</p>
