		And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.

</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
	</p>

		He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.

		And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
