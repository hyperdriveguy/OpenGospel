	<p>
		SO Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
	</p>
