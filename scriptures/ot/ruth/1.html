		<h1>Ruth Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		NOW it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
	</p>
