<li name="1">
	<p>
		IN that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.
