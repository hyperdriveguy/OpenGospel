		<h1>Ecclesiastes Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		TO every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
	</p>
