		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 15</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
