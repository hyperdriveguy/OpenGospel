		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		FOR, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The rings, and nose jewels,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.
	</p>
</li>
