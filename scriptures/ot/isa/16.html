		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 16</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		SEND ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.
	</p>
</li>
