		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 51</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEARKEN to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
	</p>
