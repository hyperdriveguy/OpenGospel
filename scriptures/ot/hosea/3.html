	<p>
		THEN said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.
