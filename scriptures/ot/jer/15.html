		<h1>Jeremiah Chapter 15</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
	</p>
</li>
