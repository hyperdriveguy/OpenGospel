		<h1>Jeremiah Chapter 30</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.
	</p>
