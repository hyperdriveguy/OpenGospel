		<h1>Nehemiah Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.
