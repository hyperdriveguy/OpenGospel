<li name="1">
	<p>
		BE merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.
