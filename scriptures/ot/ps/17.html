		<h1>Psalms Chapter 17</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thou has proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou has tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
	</p>
