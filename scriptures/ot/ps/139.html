		<h1>Psalms Chapter 139</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
	</p>
</li>
