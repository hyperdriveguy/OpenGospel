	<p>
		I WILL bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
