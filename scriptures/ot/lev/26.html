		<h1>Leviticus Chapter 26</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		YE shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
