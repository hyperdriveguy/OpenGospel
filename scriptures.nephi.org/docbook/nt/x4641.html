>5.18. Chapter 18</H1
><P
>1. AFTER these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</P
><P
>2. And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</P
><P
>3. And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</P
><P
>4. And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</P
><P
>5. And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</P
><P
>6. And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</P
><P
>7.  And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</P
><P
>8. And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</P
><P
>9. Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</P
><P
>10. For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.</P
><P
>11. And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</P
><P
>12.  And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</P
><P
>13. Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</P
><P
>14. And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</P
><P
>15. But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</P
><P
>16. And he drave them from the judgment seat.</P
><P
>17. Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat.  And Gallio cared for none of those things.</P
><P
>18.  And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</P
><P
>19. And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</P
><P
>20. When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</P
><P
>21. But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will.  And he sailed from Ephesus.</P
><P
>22. And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</P
><P
>23. And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</P
><P
>24.  And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</P
><P
>25. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</P
><P
>26. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</P
><P
>27. And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</P
><P
>28. For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</P
