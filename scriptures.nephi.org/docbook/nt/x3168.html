>4.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. WHEN therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</P
><P
>2. (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</P
><P
>3. He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</P
><P
>4. And he must needs go through Samaria.</P
><P
>5. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</P
><P
>6. Now Jacob's well was there.  Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</P
><P
>7. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</P
><P
>8. (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</P
><P
>9. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?  for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</P
><P
>10. Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</P
><P
>11. The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</P
><P
>12. Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</P
><P
>13. Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</P
><P
>14. But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</P
><P
>15. The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</P
><P
>16. Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</P
><P
>17. The woman answered and said, I have no husband.  Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</P
><P
>18. For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</P
><P
>19. The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</P
><P
>20. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</P
><P
>21. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</P
><P
>22. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</P
><P
>23. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</P
><P
>24. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</P
><P
>25. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</P
><P
>26. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</P
><P
>27.  And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou?  or, Why talkest thou with her?</P
><P
>28. The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</P
><P
>29. Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</P
><P
>30. Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</P
><P
>31.  In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</P
><P
>32. But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</P
><P
>33. Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</P
><P
>34. Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</P
><P
>35. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?  behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</P
><P
>36. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</P
><P
>37. And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</P
><P
>38. I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</P
><P
>39.  And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</P
><P
>40. So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</P
><P
>41. And many more believed because of his own word;</P
><P
>42. And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</P
><P
>43.  Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</P
><P
>44. For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</P
><P
>45. Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</P
><P
>46. So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.  And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</P
><P
>47. When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</P
><P
>48. Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</P
><P
>49. The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</P
><P
>50. Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth.  And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</P
><P
>51. And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</P
><P
>52. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend.  And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</P
><P
>53. So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</P
><P
>54. This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</P
