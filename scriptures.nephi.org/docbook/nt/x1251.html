>2.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. AND he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</P
><P
>2. And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</P
><P
>3. Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</P
><P
>4. And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</P
><P
>5. And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</P
><P
>6. But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</P
><P
>7. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</P
><P
>8. And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</P
><P
>9. And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</P
><P
>10. And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</P
><P
>11. And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</P
><P
>12. That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</P
><P
>13. And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable?  and how then will ye know all parables?</P
><P
>14.  The sower soweth the word.</P
><P
>15. And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</P
><P
>16. And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</P
><P
>17. And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</P
><P
>18. And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</P
><P
>19. And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</P
><P
>20. And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</P
><P
>21.  And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed?  and not to be set on a candlestick?</P
><P
>22. For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</P
><P
>23. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</P
><P
>24. And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</P
><P
>25. For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</P
><P
>26.  And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</P
><P
>27. And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</P
><P
>28. For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</P
><P
>29. But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</P
><P
>30.  And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?  or with what comparison shall we compare it?</P
><P
>31. It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</P
><P
>32. But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</P
><P
>33. And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</P
><P
>34. But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</P
><P
>35. And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</P
><P
>36. And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship.  And there were also with him other little ships.</P
><P
>37. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</P
><P
>38. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</P
><P
>39. And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still.  And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</P
><P
>40. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful?  how is it that ye have no faith?</P
><P
>41. And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</P
