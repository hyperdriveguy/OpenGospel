>4.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. AND the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</P
><P
>2. And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</P
><P
>3. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</P
><P
>4. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee?  mine hour is not yet come.</P
><P
>5. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</P
><P
>6. And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</P
><P
>7. Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water.  And they filled them up to the brim.</P
><P
>8. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.  And they bare it.</P
><P
>9. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</P
><P
>10. And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</P
><P
>11. This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</P
><P
>12.  After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</P
><P
>13.  And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</P
><P
>14. And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</P
><P
>15. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</P
><P
>16. And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</P
><P
>17. And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</P
><P
>18.  Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</P
><P
>19. Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</P
><P
>20. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</P
><P
>21. But he spake of the temple of his body.</P
><P
>22. When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</P
><P
>23.  Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</P
><P
>24. But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</P
><P
>25. And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</P
