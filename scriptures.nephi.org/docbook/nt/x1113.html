>1.28. Chapter 28</H1
><P
>1. IN the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</P
><P
>2. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</P
><P
>3. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</P
><P
>4. And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</P
><P
>5. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</P
><P
>6. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said.  Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</P
><P
>7. And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</P
><P
>8. And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</P
><P
>9.  And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail.  And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</P
><P
>10. Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</P
><P
>11.  Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</P
><P
>12. And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</P
><P
>13. Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</P
><P
>14. And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</P
><P
>15. So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</P
><P
>16.  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</P
><P
>17. And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</P
><P
>18. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</P
><P
>19.  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</P
><P
>20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.  Amen.</P
