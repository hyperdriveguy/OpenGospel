>3.23. Chapter 23</H1
><P
>1. AND the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</P
><P
>2. And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</P
><P
>3. And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?  And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</P
><P
>4. Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</P
><P
>5. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</P
><P
>6. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</P
><P
>7. And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</P
><P
>8.  And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</P
><P
>9. Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</P
><P
>10. And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</P
><P
>11. And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</P
><P
>12.  And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</P
><P
>13.  And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</P
><P
>14. Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</P
><P
>15. No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</P
><P
>16. I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</P
><P
>17. (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</P
><P
>18. And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</P
><P
>19. (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</P
><P
>20. Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</P
><P
>21. But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</P
><P
>22. And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done?  I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</P
><P
>23. And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified.  And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</P
><P
>24. And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</P
><P
>25. And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</P
><P
>26. And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</P
><P
>27.  And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</P
><P
>28. But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</P
><P
>29. For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</P
><P
>30. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</P
><P
>31. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</P
><P
>32. And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</P
><P
>33. And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</P
><P
>34.  Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.  And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</P
><P
>35. And the people stood beholding.  And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</P
><P
>36. And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</P
><P
>37. And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</P
><P
>38. And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</P
><P
>39.  And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</P
><P
>40. But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</P
><P
>41. And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</P
><P
>42. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</P
><P
>43. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</P
><P
>44. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</P
><P
>45. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</P
><P
>46.  And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</P
><P
>47. Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</P
><P
>48. And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</P
><P
>49. And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</P
><P
>50.  And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:</P
><P
>51. (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</P
><P
>52. This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</P
><P
>53. And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</P
><P
>54. And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</P
><P
>55. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</P
><P
>56. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</P
