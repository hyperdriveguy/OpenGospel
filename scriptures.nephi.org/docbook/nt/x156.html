>1.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. TAKE heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</P
><P
>2. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men.  Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</P
><P
>3. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</P
><P
>4. That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</P
><P
>5.  And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.  Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</P
><P
>6. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</P
><P
>7. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</P
><P
>8. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</P
><P
>9. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</P
><P
>10. Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</P
><P
>11. Give us this day our daily bread.</P
><P
>12. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</P
><P
>13. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.  Amen.</P
><P
>14. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</P
><P
>15. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</P
><P
>16.  Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.  Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</P
><P
>17. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</P
><P
>18. That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</P
><P
>19.  Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</P
><P
>20. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</P
><P
>21. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</P
><P
>22. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</P
><P
>23. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.  If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</P
><P
>24.  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.  Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</P
><P
>25. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.  Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</P
><P
>26. Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.  Are ye not much better than they?</P
><P
>27. Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</P
><P
>28. And why take ye thought for raiment?  Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</P
><P
>29. And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</P
><P
>30. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</P
><P
>31. Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?  or, What shall we drink?  or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</P
><P
>32. (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</P
><P
>33. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</P
><P
>34. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</P
