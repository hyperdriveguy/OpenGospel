>3.24. Chapter 24</H1
><P
>1. NOW upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</P
><P
>2. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</P
><P
>3. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</P
><P
>4. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</P
><P
>5. And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</P
><P
>6. He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</P
><P
>7. Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</P
><P
>8. And they remembered his words,</P
><P
>9. And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</P
><P
>10. It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</P
><P
>11. And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</P
><P
>12. Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</P
><P
>13.  And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</P
><P
>14. And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</P
><P
>15. And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</P
><P
>16. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</P
><P
>17. And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</P
><P
>18. And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days?</P
><P
>19. And he said unto them, What things?  And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</P
><P
>20. And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</P
><P
>21. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</P
><P
>22. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</P
><P
>23. And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</P
><P
>24. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</P
><P
>25. Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</P
><P
>26. Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</P
><P
>27. And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</P
><P
>28. And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</P
><P
>29. But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.  And he went in to tarry with them.</P
><P
>30. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</P
><P
>31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</P
><P
>32. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</P
><P
>33. And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</P
><P
>34. Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</P
><P
>35. And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</P
><P
>36.  And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</P
><P
>37. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</P
><P
>38. And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled?  and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</P
><P
>39. Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</P
><P
>40. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</P
><P
>41. And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</P
><P
>42. And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</P
><P
>43. And he took it, and did eat before them.</P
><P
>44. And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</P
><P
>45. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</P
><P
>46. And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</P
><P
>47. And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</P
><P
>48. And ye are witnesses of these things.</P
><P
>49.  And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</P
><P
>50.  And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</P
><P
>51. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</P
><P
>52. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</P
><P
>53. And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.  Amen.</P
