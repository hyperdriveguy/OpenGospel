>4.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</P
><P
>2. Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</P
><P
>3. His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</P
><P
>4. For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly.  If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</P
><P
>5. For neither did his brethren believe in him.</P
><P
>6. Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</P
><P
>7. The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</P
><P
>8. Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</P
><P
>9. When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</P
><P
>10.  But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</P
><P
>11. Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</P
><P
>12. And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</P
><P
>13. Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</P
><P
>14.  Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</P
><P
>15. And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</P
><P
>16. Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</P
><P
>17. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</P
><P
>18. He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</P
><P
>19. Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?  Why go ye about to kill me?</P
><P
>20. The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</P
><P
>21. Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</P
><P
>22. Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</P
><P
>23. If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</P
><P
>24. Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</P
><P
>25. Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</P
><P
>26. But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him.  Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</P
><P
>27. Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</P
><P
>28. Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</P
><P
>29. But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</P
><P
>30. Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</P
><P
>31. And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</P
><P
>32.  The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</P
><P
>33. Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</P
><P
>34. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</P
><P
>35. Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him?  will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</P
><P
>36. What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</P
><P
>37. In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</P
><P
>38. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</P
><P
>39. (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</P
><P
>40.  Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</P
><P
>41. Others said, This is the Christ.  But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</P
><P
>42. Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</P
><P
>43. So there was a division among the people because of him.</P
><P
>44. And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</P
><P
>45.  Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</P
><P
>46. The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</P
><P
>47. Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</P
><P
>48. Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</P
><P
>49. But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</P
><P
>50. Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</P
><P
>51. Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</P
><P
>52. They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</P
><P
>53. And every man went unto his own house.</P
