>27.8. Chapter 8</H1

>1. AND when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.</P
><P
>2. And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.</P
><P
>3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</P
><P
>4. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</P
><P
>5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</P
><P
>6. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</P
><P
>7. The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</P
><P
>8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;</P
><P
>9. And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</P
><P
>10. And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;</P
><P
>11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</P
><P
>12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</P
><P
>13. And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!</P
