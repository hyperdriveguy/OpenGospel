>4.12. Chapter 12</H1
><P
>1. THEN Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</P
><P
>2. There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</P
><P
>3. Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</P
><P
>4. Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,</P
><P
>5. Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</P
><P
>6. This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</P
><P
>7. Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</P
><P
>8. For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</P
><P
>9. Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</P
><P
>10.  But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</P
><P
>11. Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</P
><P
>12.  On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</P
><P
>13. Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</P
><P
>14. And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</P
><P
>15. Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</P
><P
>16. These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</P
><P
>17. The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</P
><P
>18. For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</P
><P
>19. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing?  behold, the world is gone after him.</P
><P
>20.  And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</P
><P
>21. The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</P
><P
>22. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</P
><P
>23.  And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</P
><P
>24. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</P
><P
>25. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</P
><P
>26. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</P
><P
>27. Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?  Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</P
><P
>28. Father, glorify thy name.  Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</P
><P
>29. The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</P
><P
>30. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</P
><P
>31. Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</P
><P
>32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</P
><P
>33. This he said, signifying what death he should die.</P
><P
>34. The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?  who is this Son of man?</P
><P
>35. Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you.  Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</P
><P
>36. While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.  These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</P
><P
>37.  But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</P
><P
>38. That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report?  and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</P
><P
>39. Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</P
><P
>40. He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</P
><P
>41. These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</P
><P
>42.  Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</P
><P
>43. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</P
><P
>44.  Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</P
><P
>45. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</P
><P
>46. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</P
><P
>47. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</P
><P
>48. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</P
><P
>49. For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</P
><P
>50. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</P
