>1.26. Chapter 26</H1
><P
>1. AND it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</P
><P
>2. Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</P
><P
>3. Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</P
><P
>4. And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</P
><P
>5. But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</P
><P
>6.  Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</P
><P
>7. There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</P
><P
>8. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</P
><P
>9. For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</P
><P
>10. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman?  for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</P
><P
>11. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</P
><P
>12. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</P
><P
>13. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</P
><P
>14.  Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</P
><P
>15. And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you?  And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</P
><P
>16. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</P
><P
>17.  Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</P
><P
>18. And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</P
><P
>19. And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</P
><P
>20. Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</P
><P
>21. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</P
><P
>22. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</P
><P
>23. And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</P
><P
>24. The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!  it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</P
><P
>25. Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?  He said unto him, Thou hast said.</P
><P
>26.  And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</P
><P
>27. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</P
><P
>28. For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</P
><P
>29. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</P
><P
>30. And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</P
><P
>31. Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</P
><P
>32. But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</P
><P
>33. Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</P
><P
>34. Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</P
><P
>35. Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.  Likewise also said all the disciples.</P
><P
>36.  Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</P
><P
>37. And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</P
><P
>38. Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</P
><P
>39. And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</P
><P
>40. And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</P
><P
>41. Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</P
><P
>42. He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</P
><P
>43. And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</P
><P
>44. And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</P
><P
>45. Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</P
><P
>46. Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</P
><P
>47.  And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</P
><P
>48. Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</P
><P
>49. And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</P
><P
>50. And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come?  Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</P
><P
>51. And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</P
><P
>52. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</P
><P
>53. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</P
><P
>54. But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</P
><P
>55. In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?  I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</P
><P
>56. But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.  Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</P
><P
>57.  And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</P
><P
>58. But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</P
><P
>59. Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</P
><P
>60. But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none.  At the last came two false witnesses,</P
><P
>61. And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</P
><P
>62. And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing?  what is it which these witness against thee?</P
><P
>63. But Jesus held his peace.  And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</P
><P
>64. Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</P
><P
>65. Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses?  behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</P
><P
>66. What think ye?  They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</P
><P
>67. Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</P
><P
>68. Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</P
><P
>69.  Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</P
><P
>70. But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</P
><P
>71. And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</P
><P
>72. And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</P
><P
>73. And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</P
><P
>74. Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.  And immediately the cock crew.</P
><P
>75. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  And he went out, and wept bitterly.</P
