>13.18. Chapter 18</H1
><P
>1. NOW after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</P
><P
>2. And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.</P
><P
>3.  And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</P
><P
>4. And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</P
><P
>5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</P
><P
>6. Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts.  Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</P
><P
>7. And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</P
><P
>8. Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</P
><P
>9.  Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</P
><P
>10. He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</P
><P
>11.  Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</P
><P
>12. Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</P
><P
>13.  And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants.  Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</P
><P
>14.  So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</P
><P
>15. And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.</P
><P
>16. And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</P
><P
>17. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.</P
