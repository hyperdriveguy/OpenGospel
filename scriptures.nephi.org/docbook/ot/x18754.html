>21.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. SO I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</P
><P
>2. Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</P
><P
>3. Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</P
><P
>4.  Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour.  This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</P
><P
>5. The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</P
><P
>6. Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</P
><P
>7.  Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</P
><P
>8. There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?  This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</P
><P
>9.  Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</P
><P
>10. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</P
><P
>11. Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</P
><P
>12. And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</P
><P
>13.  Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</P
><P
>14. For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</P
><P
>15. I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</P
><P
>16. There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.  Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</P
