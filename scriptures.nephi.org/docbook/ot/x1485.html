>1.46. Chapter 46</H1
><P
>1. AND Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.</P
><P
>2. And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob.  And he said, Here am I.</P
><P
>3. And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:</P
><P
>4. I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.</P
><P
>5. And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</P
><P
>6. And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:</P
><P
>7. His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.</P
><P
>8.  And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.</P
><P
>9. And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.</P
><P
>10.  And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.</P
><P
>11.  And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</P
><P
>12.  And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.  And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.</P
><P
>13.  And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.</P
><P
>14.  And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.</P
><P
>15. These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.</P
><P
>16.  And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.</P
><P
>17.  And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.</P
><P
>18. These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.</P
><P
>19. The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.</P
><P
>20.  And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.</P
><P
>21.  And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.</P
><P
>22. These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.</P
><P
>23.  And the sons of Dan; Hushim.</P
><P
>24.  And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.</P
><P
>25. These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.</P
><P
>26. All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;</P
><P
>27. And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.</P
><P
>28.  And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.</P
><P
>29. And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</P
><P
>30. And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.</P
><P
>31. And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;</P
><P
>32. And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.</P
><P
>33. And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?</P
><P
>34. That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</P
