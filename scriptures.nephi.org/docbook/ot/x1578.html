>1.49. Chapter 49</H1
><P
>1. AND Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.</P
><P
>2. Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</P
><P
>3.  Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</P
><P
>4. Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.</P
><P
>5.  Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.</P
><P
>6. O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</P
><P
>7. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</P
><P
>8.  Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.</P
><P
>9. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</P
><P
>10. The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.</P
><P
>11. Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</P
><P
>12. His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</P
><P
>13.  Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.</P
><P
>14.  Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</P
><P
>15. And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</P
><P
>16.  Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</P
><P
>17. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</P
><P
>18. I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</P
><P
>19.  Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</P
><P
>20.  Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</P
><P
>21.  Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</P
><P
>22.  Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:</P
><P
>23. The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:</P
><P
>24. But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</P
><P
>25. Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</P
><P
>26. The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</P
><P
>27.  Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</P
><P
>28.  All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</P
><P
>29. And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</P
><P
>30. In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</P
><P
>31. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</P
><P
>32. The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.</P
><P
>33. And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</P
