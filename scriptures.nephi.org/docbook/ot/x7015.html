>7.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. NOW these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</P
><P
>2. Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</P
><P
>3. Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</P
><P
>4. And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</P
><P
>5.  And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</P
><P
>6. And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</P
><P
>7. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</P
><P
>8.  Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.</P
><P
>9. And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</P
><P
>10. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.</P
><P
>11. And the land had rest forty years.  And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</P
><P
>12.  And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</P
><P
>13. And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</P
><P
>14. So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</P
><P
>15. But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</P
><P
>16. But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</P
><P
>17. And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</P
><P
>18. And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</P
><P
>19. But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence.  And all that stood by him went out from him.</P
><P
>20. And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone.  And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee.  And he arose out of his seat.</P
><P
>21. And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</P
><P
>22. And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</P
><P
>23. Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</P
><P
>24. When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</P
><P
>25. And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</P
><P
>26. And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</P
><P
>27. And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</P
><P
>28. And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.  And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</P
><P
>29. And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</P
><P
>30. So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.  And the land had rest fourscore years.</P
><P
>31.  And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</P
