>25.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</P
><P
>2. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.</P
><P
>3. Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.</P
><P
>4. My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</P
><P
>5. He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.</P
><P
>6. He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.</P
><P
>7. He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</P
><P
>8. Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</P
><P
>9. He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</P
><P
>10. He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.</P
><P
>11. He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</P
><P
>12. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</P
><P
>13. He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</P
><P
>14. I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.</P
><P
>15. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.</P
><P
>16. He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.</P
><P
>17. And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.</P
><P
>18. And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:</P
><P
>19. Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</P
><P
>20. My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</P
><P
>21. This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</P
><P
>22.  It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</P
><P
>23. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.</P
><P
>24. The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</P
><P
>25. The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.</P
><P
>26. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</P
><P
>27. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</P
><P
>28. He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.</P
><P
>29. He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</P
><P
>30. He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.</P
><P
>31. For the Lord will not cast off for ever:</P
><P
>32. But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</P
><P
>33. For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.</P
><P
>34. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,</P
><P
>35. To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,</P
><P
>36. To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.</P
><P
>37.  Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?</P
><P
>38. Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?</P
><P
>39. Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</P
><P
>40. Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.</P
><P
>41. Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.</P
><P
>42. We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.</P
><P
>43. Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</P
><P
>44. Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.</P
><P
>45. Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.</P
><P
>46. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</P
><P
>47. Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.</P
><P
>48. Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</P
><P
>49. Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,</P
><P
>50. Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.</P
><P
>51. Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.</P
><P
>52. Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</P
><P
>53. They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.</P
><P
>54. Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.</P
><P
>55.  I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</P
><P
>56. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</P
><P
>57. Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.</P
><P
>58. O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.</P
><P
>59. O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.</P
><P
>60. Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.</P
><P
>61. Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;</P
><P
>62. The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</P
><P
>63. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.</P
><P
>64.  Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.</P
><P
>65. Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.</P
><P
>66. Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.</P
