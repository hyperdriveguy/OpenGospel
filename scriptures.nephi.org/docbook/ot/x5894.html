>5.24. Chapter 24</H1
><P
>1. WHEN a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.</P
><P
>2. And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.</P
><P
>3. And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;</P
><P
>4. Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</P
><P
>5.  When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.</P
><P
>6.  No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh a man's life to pledge.</P
><P
>7.  If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.</P
><P
>8.  Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.</P
><P
>9. Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.</P
><P
>10.  When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.</P
><P
>11. Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.</P
><P
>12. And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:</P
><P
>13. In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.</P
><P
>14.  Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:</P
><P
>15. At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.</P
><P
>16. The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</P
><P
>17.  Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:</P
><P
>18. But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</P
><P
>19.  When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.</P
><P
>20. When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</P
><P
>21. When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</P
><P
>22. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</P
