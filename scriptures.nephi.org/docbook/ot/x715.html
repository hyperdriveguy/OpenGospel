>1.25. Chapter 25</H1
><P
>1. THEN again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</P
><P
>2. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</P
><P
>3. And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan.  And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</P
><P
>4. And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah.  All these were the children of Keturah.</P
><P
>5.  And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</P
><P
>6. But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</P
><P
>7. And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</P
><P
>8. Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</P
><P
>9. And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</P
><P
>10. The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</P
><P
>11.  And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.</P
><P
>12.  Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</P
><P
>13. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</P
><P
>14. And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</P
><P
>15. Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</P
><P
>16. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</P
><P
>17. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</P
><P
>18. And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.</P
><P
>19.  And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:</P
><P
>20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</P
><P
>21. And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</P
><P
>22. And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus?  And she went to enquire of the LORD.</P
><P
>23. And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</P
><P
>24.  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</P
><P
>25. And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</P
><P
>26. And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</P
><P
>27. And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</P
><P
>28. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</P
><P
>29.  And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:</P
><P
>30. And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</P
><P
>31. And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</P
><P
>32. And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</P
><P
>33. And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</P
><P
>34. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</P
