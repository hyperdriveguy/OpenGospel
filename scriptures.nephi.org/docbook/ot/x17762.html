>20.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. MY son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</P
><P
>2. For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</P
><P
>3. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</P
><P
>4. So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</P
><P
>5.  Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</P
><P
>6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</P
><P
>7.  Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</P
><P
>8. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</P
><P
>9. Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</P
><P
>10. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</P
><P
>11.  My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</P
><P
>12. For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</P
><P
>13.  Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</P
><P
>14. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</P
><P
>15. She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</P
><P
>16. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.</P
><P
>17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</P
><P
>18. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</P
><P
>19. The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</P
><P
>20. By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</P
><P
>21.  My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</P
><P
>22. So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</P
><P
>23. Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</P
><P
>24. When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</P
><P
>25. Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</P
><P
>26. For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</P
><P
>27.  Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</P
><P
>28. Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</P
><P
>29. Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</P
><P
>30.  Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</P
><P
>31.  Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</P
><P
>32. For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</P
><P
>33.  The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</P
><P
>34. Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</P
><P
>35. The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</P
