>3.19. Chapter 19</H1
><P
>1. AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</P
><P
>2. Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.</P
><P
>3.  Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.</P
><P
>4.  Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</P
><P
>5.  And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.</P
><P
>6. It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.</P
><P
>7. And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.</P
><P
>8. Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</P
><P
>9.  And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.</P
><P
>10. And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.</P
><P
>11.  Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.</P
><P
>12.  And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.</P
><P
>13.  Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.</P
><P
>14.  Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.</P
><P
>15.  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.</P
><P
>16.  Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.</P
><P
>17.  Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.</P
><P
>18.  Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.</P
><P
>19.  Ye shall keep my statutes.  Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.</P
><P
>20.  And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</P
><P
>21. And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.</P
><P
>22. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.</P
><P
>23.  And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.</P
><P
>24. But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.</P
><P
>25. And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.</P
><P
>26.  Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.</P
><P
>27. Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.</P
><P
>28. Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.</P
><P
>29.  Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.</P
><P
>30.  Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</P
><P
>31.  Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.</P
><P
>32.  Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.</P
><P
>33.  And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.</P
><P
>34. But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</P
><P
>35.  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.</P
><P
>36. Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.</P
><P
>37. Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.</P
