>1.35. Chapter 35</H1
><P
>1. AND God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</P
><P
>2. Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</P
><P
>3. And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</P
><P
>4. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</P
><P
>5. And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</P
><P
>6.  So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Beth-el, he and all the people that were with him.</P
><P
>7. And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</P
><P
>8. But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.</P
><P
>9.  And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.</P
><P
>10. And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</P
><P
>11. And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</P
><P
>12. And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</P
><P
>13. And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</P
><P
>14. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</P
><P
>15. And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.</P
><P
>16.  And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</P
><P
>17. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</P
><P
>18. And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.</P
><P
>19. And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem.</P
><P
>20. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.</P
><P
>21.  And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</P
><P
>22. And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.  Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</P
><P
>23. The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</P
><P
>24. The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:</P
><P
>25. And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:</P
><P
>26. And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.</P
><P
>27.  And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</P
><P
>28. And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</P
><P
>29. And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</P
