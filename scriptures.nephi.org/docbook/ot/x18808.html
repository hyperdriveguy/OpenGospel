>21.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. A GOOD name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</P
><P
>2.  It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</P
><P
>3. Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</P
><P
>4. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</P
><P
>5. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</P
><P
>6. For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</P
><P
>7.  Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</P
><P
>8. Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</P
><P
>9. Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</P
><P
>10. Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these?  for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</P
><P
>11.  Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</P
><P
>12. For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</P
><P
>13. Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</P
><P
>14. In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</P
><P
>15. All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</P
><P
>16. Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</P
><P
>17. Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</P
><P
>18. It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</P
><P
>19. Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.</P
><P
>20. For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</P
><P
>21. Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</P
><P
>22. For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</P
><P
>23.  All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</P
><P
>24. That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</P
><P
>25. I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:</P
><P
>26. And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</P
><P
>27. Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:</P
><P
>28. Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</P
><P
>29. Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</P
