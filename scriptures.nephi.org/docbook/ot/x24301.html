>30.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. THUS hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings.</P
><P
>2. And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</P
><P
>3. The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>4.  Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</P
><P
>5. Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</P
><P
>6. The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</P
><P
>7.  Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</P
><P
>8. And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</P
><P
>9. And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</P
><P
>10.  Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</P
><P
>11. For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</P
><P
>12. Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</P
><P
>13. But prophesy not again any more at Beth-el: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.</P
><P
>14.  Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</P
><P
>15. And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</P
><P
>16.  Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.</P
><P
>17. Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</P
