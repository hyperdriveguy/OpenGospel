>1.32. Chapter 32</H1
><P
>1. AND Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</P
><P
>2. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</P
><P
>3. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</P
><P
>4. And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:</P
><P
>5. And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</P
><P
>6.  And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</P
><P
>7. Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;</P
><P
>8. And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</P
><P
>9.  And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</P
><P
>10. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.</P
><P
>11. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.</P
><P
>12. And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</P
><P
>13.  And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</P
><P
>14. Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</P
><P
>15. Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</P
><P
>16. And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</P
><P
>17. And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou?  and whither goest thou?  and whose are these before thee?</P
><P
>18. Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.</P
><P
>19. And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</P
><P
>20. And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</P
><P
>21. So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</P
><P
>22. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</P
><P
>23. And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</P
><P
>24.  And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</P
><P
>25. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</P
><P
>26. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh.  And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</P
><P
>27. And he said unto him, What is thy name?  And he said, Jacob.</P
><P
>28. And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</P
><P
>29. And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.  And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?  And he blessed him there.</P
><P
>30. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</P
><P
>31. And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</P
><P
>32. Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.</P
