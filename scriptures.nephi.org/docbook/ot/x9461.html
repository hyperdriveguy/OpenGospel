>11.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. SO king Solomon was king over all Israel.</P
><P
>2. And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,</P
><P
>3. Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.</P
><P
>4. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:</P
><P
>5. And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:</P
><P
>6. And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.</P
><P
>7.  And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.</P
><P
>8. And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:</P
><P
>9. The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:</P
><P
>10. The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:</P
><P
>11. The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:</P
><P
>12. Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:</P
><P
>13. The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:</P
><P
>14. Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:</P
><P
>15. Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:</P
><P
>16. Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:</P
><P
>17. Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:</P
><P
>18. Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:</P
><P
>19. Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.</P
><P
>20.  Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.</P
><P
>21. And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</P
><P
>22.  And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,</P
><P
>23. Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.</P
><P
>24. For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.</P
><P
>25. And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.</P
><P
>26.  And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.</P
><P
>27. And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.</P
><P
>28. Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.</P
><P
>29.  And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.</P
><P
>30. And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</P
><P
>31. For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.</P
><P
>32. And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.</P
><P
>33. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</P
><P
>34. And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.</P
