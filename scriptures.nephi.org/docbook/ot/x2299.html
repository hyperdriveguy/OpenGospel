>2.23. Chapter 23</H1
><P
>1. THOU shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.</P
><P
>2.  Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:</P
><P
>3.  Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.</P
><P
>4.  If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</P
><P
>5. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.</P
><P
>6. Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.</P
><P
>7. Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.</P
><P
>8.  And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</P
><P
>9.  Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</P
><P
>10. And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:</P
><P
>11. But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat.  In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.</P
><P
>12. Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.</P
><P
>13. And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</P
><P
>14.  Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.</P
><P
>15. Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)</P
><P
>16. And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.</P
><P
>17. Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.</P
><P
>18. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</P
><P
>19. The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God.  Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.</P
><P
>20.  Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</P
><P
>21. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.</P
><P
>22. But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.</P
><P
>23. For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.</P
><P
>24. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.</P
><P
>25. And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.</P
><P
>26.  There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.</P
><P
>27. I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.</P
><P
>28. And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.</P
><P
>29. I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.</P
><P
>30. By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.</P
><P
>31. And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.</P
><P
>32. Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.</P
><P
>33. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</P
