><P
>3. And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.</P
><P
>4. And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof.</P
><P
>5. And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.</P
><P
>6. And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass.</P
><P
>7. And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.</P
><P
