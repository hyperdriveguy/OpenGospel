>24.49. Chapter 49</H1
><P
>1. CONCERNING the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons?  hath he no heir?  why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?</P
><P
>2. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>3. Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.</P
><P
>4. Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter?  that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?</P
><P
>5. Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</P
><P
>6. And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>7.  Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman?  is counsel perished from the prudent?  is their wisdom vanished?</P
><P
>8. Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.</P
><P
>9. If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes?  if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</P
><P
>10. But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.</P
><P
>11. Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</P
><P
>12. For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished?  thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.</P
><P
>13. For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes;</P
><P
>14. I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</P
><P
>15. For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.</P
><P
>16. Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>17. Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</P
><P
>18. As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.</P
><P
>19. Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?  for who is like me?  and who will appoint me the time?  and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</P
><P
>20. Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</P
><P
>21. The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.</P
><P
>22. Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</P
><P
>23.  Concerning Damascus.  Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</P
><P
>24. Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</P
><P
>25. How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</P
><P
>26. Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</P
><P
>27. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.</P
><P
>28.  Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.</P
><P
>29. Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.</P
><P
>30.  Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</P
><P
>31. Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.</P
><P
>32. And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>33. And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.</P
><P
>34.  The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</P
><P
>35. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</P
><P
>36. And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</P
><P
>37. For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:</P
><P
>38. And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>39.  But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.</P
