><P
>1. THE proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</P
><P
>2. To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</P
><P
>3. To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</P
><P
>4. To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</P
><P
>5. A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</P
><P
>6. To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</P
><P
>7.  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</P
><P
>8. My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</P
><P
>9. For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</P
><P
>10.  My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</P
><P
>11. If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</P
><P
>12. Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</P
><P
>13. We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</P
><P
>14. Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</P
><P
>15. My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</P
><P
>16. For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</P
><P
>17. Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</P
><P
>18. And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</P
><P
>19. So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</P
><P
>20.  Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</P
><P
>21. She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</P
><P
>22. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?  and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</P
><P
>23. Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</P
><P
>24.  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</P
><P
>25. But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</P
><P
>26. I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</P
><P
>27. When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</P
><P
>28. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</P
><P
>29. For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</P
><P
>30. They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</P
><P
>31. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</P
><P
>32. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</P
><P
>33. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</P
