>20.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. MY son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</P
><P
>2. Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</P
><P
>3. Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</P
><P
>4. Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</P
><P
>5. Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</P
><P
>6.  Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</P
><P
>7. Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</P
><P
>8. Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</P
><P
>9. How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?  when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</P
><P
>10. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</P
><P
>11. So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</P
><P
>12.  A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</P
><P
>13. He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</P
><P
>14. Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</P
><P
>15. Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</P
><P
>16.  These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</P
><P
>17. A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</P
><P
>18. An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</P
><P
>19. A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</P
><P
>20.  My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</P
><P
>21. Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.</P
><P
>22. When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</P
><P
>23. For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</P
><P
>24. To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</P
><P
>25. Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</P
><P
>26. For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</P
><P
>27. Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</P
><P
>28. Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</P
><P
>29. So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</P
><P
>30. Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</P
><P
>31. But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</P
><P
>32. But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</P
><P
>33. A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</P
><P
>34. For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</P
><P
>35. He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</P
