>21.10. Chapter 10</H1
><P
>1. DEAD flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</P
><P
>2. A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</P
><P
>3. Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</P
><P
>4. If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</P
><P
>5. There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:</P
><P
>6. Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</P
><P
>7. I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</P
><P
>8. He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</P
><P
>9. Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</P
><P
>10. If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</P
><P
>11. Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</P
><P
>12. The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</P
><P
>13. The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</P
><P
>14. A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</P
><P
>15. The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</P
><P
>16.  Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</P
><P
>17. Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</P
><P
>18.  By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</P
><P
>19.  A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.</P
><P
>20.  Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</P
