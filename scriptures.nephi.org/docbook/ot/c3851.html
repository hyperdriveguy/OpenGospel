><P
>1. AND the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</P
><P
>2. Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls;</P
><P
>3. From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.</P
><P
>4. And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.</P

><P
>18. And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.</P
><P
>19. As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.</P

><P
>33. Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.</P
><P
>34.  Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</P
><P
>35. Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Manasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.</P
><P
>36.  Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</P
><P
>37. Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.</P
><P
>38.  Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</P
><P
>39. Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.</P

><P
>46. Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.</P
><P
>47.  But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.</P
><P
>48. For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,</P
><P
>49. Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:</P
><P
>50. But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.</P
><P
>51. And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</P
><P
>52. And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.</P
><P
>53. But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.</P
><P
>54. And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</P
